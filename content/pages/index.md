      I'm currently best known for being one of the people who started e/acc, a
      techno-optimist accelerationist movement that proliferated Twitter, and
      has captured Silicon Valley. You can read about that here:

      My professional background has been in the film, music, and technology
      industry. I am a member of IATSE 476 and have worked on 8 television
      productions for studios such as Fox, NBC, Universal, and Apple. I have
      over a decade of experience in electronic music production and DJ
      professionally under an alias. I have worked as both a designer and
      developer for several start-ups.


      My current obsession is improving audio for machine learning. Currently I
      am focused on pre-training optimizations, which I think is currently
      handled poorly, and which I believe I can vastly improve. I plan to raise
      venture capital for this ends. To that end:
