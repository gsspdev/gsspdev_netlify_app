I intend to write a new piece about e/acc, my role in it, and where I think it needs to head. A serious topic worthy of nuance and reflection. 


For now, this article from the New Yorker will have to suffice. It's quite a long article which covers some of the other Bay Area technology movements, so search for "e/acc" or my name, "Benjamin Hampikian" if you'd just like to read the section concerning e/acc:
